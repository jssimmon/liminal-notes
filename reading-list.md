**Currently Reading (And Pretending I'll Finish All Of These)**

A running list of what I'm reading right now—academic work, fiction, the occasional book about something completely random. Some of these I'll finish. Some will sit on my nightstand judging me for months.

### Sociology & The Social World

Books that provide a lens for understanding the architecture of our social reality.

* **The Social Construction of Reality** by Peter L. Berger and Thomas Luckmann
    * A foundational text on how we collectively create the world we inhabit.
* **Distinction: A Social Critique of the Judgement of Taste** by Pierre Bourdieu
    * A dense but essential work on how taste and culture function as markers of social class.
* **The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life** by Erving Goffman
    * The seminal work on the dramaturgical model of social interaction—how we are all actors on a stage.

### Secularism, Humanism & Nonreligion

Thinking critically about belief, doubt, and the institutions that structure them.

* **A Secular Age** by Charles Taylor
    * A monumental (and challenging) history of what it means to live in a world where belief in God is no longer the default.
* **The Varieties of Atheism** by David Newheiser
    * Moves beyond the New Atheism debates to explore the diverse and complex traditions of unbelief.
* **Creating a Secular Sacred** by Jérôme Ravat
    * An interesting exploration of how meaning, ritual, and the "sacred" can exist in non-religious contexts.

### Contrarian Takes & Political Thought

Books that challenge comforting narratives and poke at established orthodoxies.

* **Seeing Like a State** by James C. Scott
    * A brilliant and unsettling look at why large-scale, top-down social planning so often ends in disaster.
* **The Righteous Mind: Why Good People Are Divided by Politics and Religion** by Jonathan Haidt
    * A crucial book for understanding the moral foundations that underlie different political tribes.
* **On Bullshit** by Harry G. Frankfurt
    * A short, sharp, and permanently relevant philosophical essay on the difference between lying and bullshitting.

### World-Building (Fictional & Otherwise)

In my off-hours, I build worlds with Lego and Warhammer. These books do the same with words, exploring complex systems and imagined futures.

* **The Horus Heresy** series (Warhammer 40,000)
    * The foundational epic of the Warhammer 40k universe. Start with *Horus Rising* by Dan Abnett.
* **Dune** by Frank Herbert
    * The ultimate novel of politics, religion, ecology, and power wrapped in a sci-fi epic.
* **Perdido Street Station** by China Miéville
    * A masterpiece of the "New Weird" genre, showcasing impossibly imaginative and gritty world-building.
