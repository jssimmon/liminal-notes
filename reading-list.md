**currently reading**

A running list of what I'm reading right now (and what I have read). A significant portion of my reading is tied up with the sociology of religion, skepticism, etc. This is complemented by a consistent study of the writer's craft, from academic prose to narrative structure. For leisure, I prefer escapism through extensive reading in fantasy, sci-fi, and mystery.
