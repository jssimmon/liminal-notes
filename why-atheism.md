People sometimes ask why I spend so much time on atheism. The topic seems settled, either a boring conclusion or a hostile position. My answer is that most of us are looking at the wrong part of the story. The interesting questions have nothing to do with whether a god exists.

A good example comes from my recent work on Indigenous non-belief. A common assumption, a colonial stereotype, is that Indigenous identity is inseparable from spirituality. But narratives show a growing number of Indigenous people are leaving religion, both colonial Christianity and traditional supernaturalism. Their reasons are complex. Some are reacting to the trauma of religious colonization. Others find naturalistic worldviews more compelling. They are not abandoning their culture. They are asserting a right to intellectual self-determination by decoupling cultural identity from supernatural belief.

This is a perfect illustration of why the subject is so compelling. The real story is found in these overlooked spaces.

Studying non-belief is a way to examine how communities navigate profound social change. You get to see how secular values and institutions rise and what replaces religious frameworks. You learn how people construct meaningful lives and moral systems without divine authority. This is one of the major social transformations of our time, happening right now.

The study of atheism also provides a sharp lens for looking at stigma and social boundaries. You can explore how ex-Muslims navigate the double-bind of leaving their faith while being accused of feeding Islamophobia. You can examine how non-believers in deeply religious regions manage their social identities. This work reveals the mechanisms of in-group loyalty and out-group hostility in a raw, observable way.

Finally, non-religion is a major, if under-examined, factor in modern politics. The divide between the religious and the non-religious is now one of the most reliable predictors of political behaviour in North America. Understanding the values, demographics, and political goals of non-believers is essential to understanding the political landscape.

Studying atheism is not about debating theology. The work is about exploring human agency. The goal is to understand how people untangle themselves from historical trauma, family expectations, and cultural pressure to find their own intellectual path. That story is far more interesting than the old arguments.
