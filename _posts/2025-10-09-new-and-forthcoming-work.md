It’s been a productive season, and I have a few new and forthcoming pieces I’m excited to share. My first published short story, “Les Guérisseurs,” is in the latest issue of *On Spec* (Vol 35, No 3), Canada’s premier magazine of the fantastic.

For those who don't know, *On Spec* is a legendary, Edmonton-based journal with a 35-year history of publishing speculative fiction with a uniquely Canadian perspective. They foster emerging writers and have been an anchor for the literary scene here for decades. Getting a story in their pages is a huge honour.

You can, and should, support this fantastic magazine. Due to rising costs, they are currently digital-only. The best way to get a copy is to subscribe for a year for only $14.99 CDN via PayPal to `onspecmag@gmail.com`. You can find all the details on their "[Buy On Spec](https://onspec.ca/buy-on-spec/)" page.

My next magazine article has been accepted for publication in *Free Inquiry*. 

The piece is tentatively titled "The Pathologist and the Prophet: Stephen A. Kent, Massimo Introvigne, and the Battle for an Honest Study of Religion." Speaking of which, I want to give a plug for **Stephen Kent's** monumental new book, **"Psychobiographies and Godly Visions: Disordered Minds and the Origins of Religiosity."** It's a challenging, fascinating, and essential read for anyone interested in the psychology of belief.
