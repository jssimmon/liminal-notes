title: "The funny business with paragraphs"

At a conference recently, the keynote speaker, a big name in academic writing, questioned why anyone focuses so much on the paragraph. To steel-man his argument, perhaps he disliked the mechanical approach of topic sentences and transitions, or maybe he felt the paragraph was a crutch for writing coaches. Whatever his reasoning, he was wrong. I am unabashedly pro-paragraph, both as a unit of composition and as a tool for teaching writerly thinking.

The paragraph is where students practice the fundamental moves of academic argument on a manageable scale. Within its bounds, writers learn to make a claim, substantiate it, and connect it to larger ideas—a rehearsal for the work they must do across an entire paper. This isn't a reductive formula; this is scaffolding. The paragraph is where abstraction meets application and where ideas develop through elaboration rather than mere assertion. Dismissing this as overly formulaic misunderstands how expertise develops. Writers don’t leap directly to sophisticated discourse management; they build upward from smaller competencies.

The paragraph itself is not an arbitrary convention but a cognitive technology. Before the printing press, readers encountered walls of continuous prose. The modern paragraph, with its visual separation and conceptual unity, developed to meet the needs of expanding literacy. The form serves as a cognitive marker, signaling that one unit of thought has concluded and a new one is beginning. This structure aligns with how human working memory processes information; we need these moments of consolidation before moving on. At its core, the paragraph is a reader-centered feature. When we teach students to write in paragraphs, we teach them to be considerate architects of their readers' experience.

This reader-centered function is clearest in the role of topic sentences. A well-crafted topic sentence does more than introduce a paragraph's content; it creates a through-line that guides readers through the paper's argumentative arc. This respects the realities of academic reading. Scholars are not novelists. They approach texts strategically, looking for the intellectual payoff before committing to a deep read. Topic sentences function as an internal GPS, allowing readers to orient themselves quickly, assess relevance, and extract key claims. A paper with strong topic sentences announces its own intellectual architecture, making its contribution legible even to those who engage with it selectively.

We must acknowledge that academic reading is rarely an immersive, start-to-finish experience. Scholars read with purpose and efficiency in stolen moments between other obligations. In this ecology of attention, the paragraph is an invaluable unit of meaning. When we teach students to craft coherent paragraphs, we are initiating them into the pragmatic conventions of a discourse community. We are teaching them that clarity is not a constraint on sophistication but a prerequisite for it.

I'm pro-paragraph not because I fetishize form over content, but because form enables content to travel. The paragraph is where ideas become communicable, where individual insights are shaped into units that can be remembered, cited, and built upon. A paragraph is where writing becomes not just an act of expression, but one of participation in a larger scholarly conversation.
