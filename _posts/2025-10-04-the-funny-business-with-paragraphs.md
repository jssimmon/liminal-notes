Here's the revised version with no sentences beginning with "It":

I was at a conference not too long ago, and the keynote speaker, a kind of big player in the US academic writing space, made a comment that he didn't understand why paragraphs got so much focus from writing studies people. I rolled my eyes at the time because it takes very little time to understand why we put so much emphasis on the paragraph. But if I were to steel-up his argument, what was he getting at? Perhaps he didn't like the mechanical approach with topic sentence, supporting sentences, and some kind of closer (transition, summary, etc.). Maybe he thought it was better pedagogically to focus on nurturing more holistic approaches to clarity. Or perhaps he just felt it was a crutch for writing coaches. We'll never know, but I'm unabashedly pro-paragraph as both a unit of composition and a tool for teaching writerly thinking.

The paragraph offers something that broader discourse-level instruction often struggles to provide. At this manageable scale, students can practice the fundamental moves of academic argument. Within the bounds of a paragraph, writers learn to make a claim, substantiate it, and connect it to larger ideas. They rehearse in miniature what they'll need to do across an entire paper. This approach isn't reductive or mechanical. The paragraph is scaffolding. The space becomes one where abstraction meets application, where students can see how ideas develop through accumulation and elaboration rather than mere assertion.

Dismissing paragraph-level instruction as overly formulaic misunderstands how expertise develops. Writers don't leap directly to sophisticated discourse management. They build upward from smaller competencies. The paragraph provides crucial feedback loops. The form is short enough that students can revise it multiple times in a single session, long enough that they must grapple with coherence and development. To abandon this middle ground in favor of either sentence-level mechanics or essay-level architecture is to remove one of the most pedagogically productive sites of writing instruction we have.

We should also consider why paragraphs exist in the first place. The paragraph is not an arbitrary convention but a cognitive technology that emerged to meet specific needs of readers and writers. Before the printing press standardized textual presentation, continuous prose was far more common. Readers encountered walls of text broken only by occasional capitals or pilcrows. The modern paragraph, with its visual separation and conceptual unity, developed as literacy expanded and texts became more complex. The form serves as a visual and cognitive marker, signaling to readers that a discrete unit of thought has concluded and a new one is beginning. This chunking isn't merely aesthetic. The structure aligns with how human working memory processes information. We need these breathing spaces, these moments of consolidation, before moving to the next idea.

The paragraph is fundamentally a reader-centered feature. The form acknowledges that sustained attention requires structure, that comprehension depends on knowing where one idea ends and another begins. When we teach students to write in paragraphs, we're teaching them to be considerate architects of their readers' experience. We're asking them to think not just about what they want to say, but about how that information will be encountered, processed, and retained.

This reader-centered function becomes especially clear when we consider the role of topic sentences in establishing linearity across a paper. A well-crafted topic sentence does far more than introduce a paragraph's content. The opening sentence creates a through-line, a logical progression that guides readers from one conceptual moment to the next. When readers can skim the opening sentence of each paragraph and discern the paper's argumentative arc, they're able to navigate complex ideas with confidence. They can predict where the writer is headed, recall where they've been, and situate new information within an emerging framework.

This approach is not handholding. The practice respects the realities of academic reading. Scholars don't read papers the way they read novels. They approach texts strategically, often under time pressure, looking for the intellectual payoff before committing to a deep read. They might skim abstracts, scan introduction and conclusion, then jump to specific sections that speak to their research interests. In this context, topic sentences function as a kind of internal GPS system. They allow readers to orient themselves quickly, to assess relevance, and to extract key claims without wading through every supporting detail. A paper with strong topic sentences is a paper that announces its own intellectual architecture, making its contribution legible even to those who engage with it partially or selectively.

We must acknowledge that academic reading is rarely the immersive, start-to-finish experience that writing instructors might wish for. Scholars are simultaneously managing teaching loads, grant deadlines, committee work, and their own research agendas. They read on the train, between meetings, in stolen moments at the end of exhausting days. They read with purpose and efficiency, looking for ideas they can use, cite, build upon, or refute. In this ecology of attention, the paragraph becomes an invaluable unit of meaning. The paragraph is substantial enough to contain a complete thought, compact enough to be absorbed in a brief sitting.

When we teach students to craft coherent paragraphs with clear topic sentences, we're not imposing arbitrary rules. We're initiating them into the pragmatic conventions of a discourse community that has evolved these forms for good reasons. We're showing them how to make their ideas accessible to readers who are intelligent and interested but also busy and strategic. We're teaching them that clarity is not a constraint on sophistication but a prerequisite for understanding. The most complex arguments are those that can be followed, challenged, and extended by others.

I'm unabashedly pro-paragraph, not because I fetishize form over content, but because I recognize that form enables content to travel. The paragraph is where ideas become communicable, where individual insights are shaped into units that can be remembered, cited, and built upon. The paragraph is where writing becomes not just expression but participation in a larger scholarly conversation.
