My academic journey has been... weird. I started in philosophy, detoured through programming, and ultimately landed in sociology, with a focus on secularism and nonreligion. This path has left me with a deep appreciation for interdisciplinary work and a tendency to find myself at the intersection of different fields.

This page highlights some of the collaborative work that has emerged from that journey, blending sociological inquiry with other domains.

### Featured Collaborator: Ajay Sandhu

A significant portion of my recent work has been in collaboration with Ajay Sandhu (Toronto Metropolitan University). Our projects often bridge sociology with criminology, media studies, and the study of religion.

#### **Selected Co-Authored Publications:**

* **Police officers as filmmakers: the cinematography of body worn cameras** (2023)  
    *Published in* Policing and Society, 33 (5), 593-603.  
    In this paper, we analyzed body-worn camera footage not just as evidence, but as a form of cinematography, exploring how the officer-as-filmmaker frames events and shapes narratives.

* **Between Islam and Islamophobia: Stigma management among Canadian atheist activists** (2020)  
    *Published in* Secular Studies, 2 (2), 117-137.  
    Here, we examined how atheist activists of Muslim heritage navigate the dual stigmas of apostasy from within their former communities and Islamophobia from without.
