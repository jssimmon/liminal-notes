### Research Project: Indigenous Nonreligion

**Title:** Indigenous nonreligion in Aotearoa New Zealand and Canada  
**Fund:** Marsden Fund (Wellington, NZ)  
**Role:** Associate Investigator

> Indigenous nonreligion is rapidly increasing, surpassing national averages in Aotearoa New Zealand and Canada. In both contexts, this growth coincides with a significant drop in the number of people identifying as Christians. What drives the rise of Indigenous nonreligion, and how does it connect to broader trends of dechristianisation, secularisation, decolonial movements, and societal change?
>
> This project explores the individual, sociocultural, historical, and political processes contributing to the rise of Indigenous nonreligion through a comparative case study of Aotearoa and Canada... By centring Indigenous expressions of nonreligion and exploring its connection with decolonial activism, the findings of this comparative project will address a critical gap in the cross-cultural study of nonreligion, provide new perspectives on the ongoing debate on secularisation, and advance our understanding of contemporary religious change.

### Book Chapter: AI and Academic Writing

**Working Title:** "Did I Write That?": Unpacking False AI Plagiarism Accusations in Academic Writing  
**Publication:** *Generative AI-Enhanced Research: Ethical, Practical, and Transformative Approaches* (Forthcoming)

> An invited chapter submission exploring the challenges and ethical dimensions of false accusations of AI-driven plagiarism in academic settings. The chapter will be part of a two-volume open book publication and will undergo peer review.

### Creative Writing: Short Fiction

**Story:** "Les Guérisseurs"  
**Publication:** *On Spec Magazine*, Issue #133

> An inherited family magical gift often calls for sacrifices, and "Les Guérisseurs" explores this theme. I was pleased to contribute this short story alongside a talented group of new and established authors. The issue also features works by Liz Westbrook-Trenholm, Gillian Secord, John Park, and many others, covering everything from sentient magical bags to Icelandic mythology.
