**current projects**

This is kind of a grab bag. Some stuff I'm working on now, some stuff that's coming out soon, some stuff that already happened but doesn't fit neatly on the other pages.

### research project: indigenous nonreligion

**Title:** Indigenous nonreligion in Aotearoa New Zealand and Canada  
**Fund:** Marsden Fund (Wellington, NZ)  
**Role:** Associate Investigator

> Indigenous nonreligion is rapidly increasing, surpassing national averages in Aotearoa New Zealand and Canada. In both contexts, this growth coincides with a significant drop in the number of people identifying as Christians. What drives the rise of Indigenous nonreligion, and how does it connect to broader trends of dechristianisation, secularisation, decolonial movements, and societal change?
>
> This project explores the individual, sociocultural, historical, and political processes contributing to the rise of Indigenous nonreligion through a comparative case study of Aotearoa and Canada... By centring Indigenous expressions of nonreligion and exploring its connection with decolonial activism, the findings of this comparative project will address a critical gap in the cross-cultural study of nonreligion, provide new perspectives on the ongoing debate on secularisation, and advance our understanding of contemporary religious change.

### book chapter: deconversion and indigenous traditions

**Working Title:** "De-Converting from North American Religious Traditions"  
**Publication:** *The Oxford Handbook of Apostasy and Religious Deconversion* (Forthcoming)

> An invited chapter for the *Oxford Handbook* series. This work examines the overlooked phenomenon of Indigenous deconversion in North America, focusing on individuals who have rejected both colonial Christianity and traditional supernatural worldviews. The chapter explores how Indigenous peoples navigate pathways of disbelief in contexts that often equate cultural identity with spirituality, arguing that recognizing these diverse philosophical journeys is essential for understanding the full spectrum of responses to colonization.

### book chapter: ai and academic writing

**Working Title:** "Did I Write That?": Unpacking False AI Plagiarism Accusations in Academic Writing  
**Publication:** *Generative AI-Enhanced Research: Ethical, Practical, and Transformative Approaches* (Forthcoming)

> An invited chapter submission exploring the challenges and ethical dimensions of false accusations of AI-driven plagiarism in academic settings. The chapter will be part of a two-volume open book publication and will undergo peer review.

### creative writing: short fiction

**Story:** "Les Guérisseurs"  
**Publication:** *On Spec Magazine*, Issue #133
