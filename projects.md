**current projects**

This is kind of a grab bag. Some stuff I'm working on now, some stuff that's coming out soon, some stuff that already happened but doesn't fit neatly on the other pages. Research, book chapters, short fiction—it's all here.

### research project: indigenous nonreligion

**Title:** Indigenous nonreligion in Aotearoa New Zealand and Canada  
**Fund:** Marsden Fund (Wellington, NZ)  
**Role:** Associate Investigator

> Indigenous nonreligion is rapidly increasing, surpassing national averages in Aotearoa New Zealand and Canada. In both contexts, this growth coincides with a significant drop in the number of people identifying as Christians. What drives the rise of Indigenous nonreligion, and how does it connect to broader trends of dechristianisation, secularisation, decolonial movements, and societal change?
>
> This project explores the individual, sociocultural, historical, and political processes contributing to the rise of Indigenous nonreligion through a comparative case study of Aotearoa and Canada... By centring Indigenous expressions of nonreligion and exploring its connection with decolonial activism, the findings of this comparative project will address a critical gap in the cross-cultural study of nonreligion, provide new perspectives on the ongoing debate on secularisation, and advance our understanding of contemporary religious change.
