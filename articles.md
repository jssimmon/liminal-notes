My scholarly work explores the sociology of non-religion, with a focus on atheist activism and identity. A recurring theme across these publications is the tension between individualism and community. I am particularly interested in how non-believers navigate internal political conflicts, manage social stigma, and construct meaningful identities in a world that often defaults to belief.
