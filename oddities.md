### synthwave

My love for synthwave runs deep. Here are a few channels and tracks that capture the specific retro-futuristic atmosphere I enjoy.

* **[VISION84](https://www.youtube.com/@VISION84-No5)**
    A fellow enthusiast who makes music in Logic Pro, describing his passion this way: "Used to focus on electric guitar and singing in the shower, but my love has always been synthwave music."

It's fascinating how a sound so breezy and carefree can also feel so melancholic in retrospect.

* **[Skylines and Supras: Exploring City Pop's Resurgence in the Age of Anemoia](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zOLojLfVsybBHEo2Se0YnhtHoxiIqzJ9/view)**
    I'm not the only one fascinated by this. The author writes: "I link the ideas of Internet aesthetics, 80s music, neoliberalism, and more, connecting it to the phenomenon of nostalgia for a time we never existed in, which I believe is responsible for City Pop's (semi) recent resurgence..."
