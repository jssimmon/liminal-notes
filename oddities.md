### synthwave

My love for synthwave runs deep. Here are a few channels and tracks that capture the specific retro-futuristic atmosphere I enjoy.

* **[VISION84](https://www.youtube.com/@VISION84-No5)**
    A fellow enthusiast who makes music in Logic Pro, describing his passion this way: "Used to focus on electric guitar and singing in the shower, but my love has always been synthwave music." A great example of the mood he creates is the mix **["It’s 1986 and You’re Alone in a Rainy Diner at 2AM"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_IZ4B7-Xuk0)**.

* **[The Midnight - Sunset](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlW1w6gCWr8)**
    From the channel *Retrowave Cinema*, which perfectly pairs retrowave music with scenes from 80's films. This track is a quintessential example of the genre.

* **[The Midnight - 'Friction'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LVwgSIheW1Y)**
    The Midnight (Tyler Lyle and Tim McEwan) are masters of capturing a specific kind of nostalgia. Their own words sum it up best: "There is a Japanese term: Mono no aware. It means basically, the sad beauty of seeing time pass - the aching awareness of impermanence. These are the days that we will return to one day in the future only in memories."

### city pop

I've been falling down a rabbit hole of Japanese City Pop from the 1980s[**.**](https://youtu.be/R0DXhUF1hP8?si=bB5bA111nylZrSXY). It's a genre built on an almost impossibly optimistic and luxurious vibe—a soundtrack for an economic boom that felt like it would never end. It's fascinating how a sound so breezy and carefree can also feel so melancholic in retrospect.

* **[Skylines and Supras: Exploring City Pop's Resurgence in the Age of Anemoia](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zOLojLfVsybBHEo2Se0YnhtHoxiIqzJ9/view)**
    I'm not the only one fascinated by this. A recent dissertation on the topic perfectly captures the phenomenon. The author writes: "I link the ideas of Internet aesthetics, 80s music, neoliberalism, and more, connecting it to the phenomenon of nostalgia for a time we never existed in, which I believe is responsible for City Pop's (semi) recent resurgence... Hope some of you might find this worth a read!"
